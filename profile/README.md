# Welcome to Iterative AI
**The core automation engine behind the [Universal Automation Wiki](https://universalautomation.wiki)**

Iterative AI is a bottom-up, agent-based system designed for breaking down complex tasks by using a task hierarchy and driven by metrics and community feedback.

## What is Iterative AI?

Iterative AI is a modular system for generating, evaluating, and refining automation solutions using AI agents and hierarchical decomposition. Instead of starting with abstract goals, we begin with what’s already possible, existing tools, technologies, and known processes, and iteratively build upward.

Each task is represented as a tree of alternative solutions. Every branch is a candidate path to automation, scored by defined metrics and refined through community feedback.

## Core Features

- **Bottom-Up Design**  
  Starts from known capabilities and works toward automation, not the other way around.

- **Tree-Based Task Modeling**  
  Complex tasks are broken down into multiple layers of subtasks and alternative implementations.

- **Metrics-Based Evaluation**  
  Each output is assessed using Boolean and quantitative checks tied to specific user needs.

- **LLM-Driven Generation**  
  Content and trees are generated using local LLMs with transparent, explainable reasoning.

- **Community Feedback Integration**  
  Users can vote on and submit alternative implementations, helping refine the knowledge base.
